# scalts

The goal of this library is to provide some scala like monades and functional feature.

* Optional (Some, None)
* Either (Left, Right)
* Try (Success, Failure)
* Future

And have something for-comprehension for each of this features

like scalaz with like a [scalaz ApplicativeBuilder](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/scalaz-seven/core/src/main/scala/scalaz/syntax/ApplySyntax.scala).
